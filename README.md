# GPT-3.5-Turbo-Bot

### Get the bot 'shell' from Discord. It's free, and it takes 5 minutes
```sh
https://discord.com/developers/applications
```
### Go to OpenAI and open an account. (This is the exact same account that other services upcharge for)
```sh
https://platform.openai.com/signup
```
### Install node.js
```sh
https://nodejs.org/en/
```
### Install git:
```sh
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```
### Create a new folder and navigate to it in terminal to set up git
```sh
git init
```
### Navigate to new git folder in terminal and clone this repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lane-G-Smith/VanillaDiscordBot-GPT-3.5-Turbo.git
```
### Navigate to VanillaDiscordBotGPT-3.5-Turbo folder and install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
### Create new file in VanillaDiscordBotGPT-3.5-Turbo folder and name it .env
```sh
```
### Place your secret Discord bot token from the first step into the .env file:
```sh
TYPE THIS EXACTLY, IT IS CASE SENSITIVE: TOKEN=your_unique_token_here
```
### Place your secret OpenAI API key from the second step into the .env file:
```sh
TYPE THIS EXACTLY, IT IS CASE SENSITIVE: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_unique_API_key_here
```
### Replace three lines in the code (40,41,42, self explanatory when you look at it) to personalize functionality
```sh
The characteristics of your AI and how to answer questions, one example question, one example answer.
```
### To host the bot locally, open project terminal and run a node server
```sh
node index.js
```
### Congradulations, your bot should now be live & confirmation should be logged in the terminal. Use your personal link from the Discord developer portal to invite your bot to a Discord server
```sh
https://discord.com/developers/applications
```
